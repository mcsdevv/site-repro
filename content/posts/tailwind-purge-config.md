So, I wrote a [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org) plugin for [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/what-is-tailwind/) and [PurgeCSS](https://www.purgecss.com/). It lets you add both Tailwind and PurgeCSS in one line in your Gridsome config file. It's pretty slick, if I do say so myself  [Find it on GitHub.](https://github.com/brandonpittman/gridsome-plugin-tailwindcss)
