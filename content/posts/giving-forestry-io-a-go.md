Not much to say here. Just testing out [Forestry.io](https://forestry.io). I'm rather impressed by the ease of setup. I swear I tried this out earlier in the year, and had some sort of issue with it. This time, however, it was a breeze to set up, and I'm really digging itâ€”at least until [TinaCMS](https://tinacms.org) is ready to work with Vue/Gridsome. Until then, this should do nicely! ðŸ¥³

The only issue I really had was getting media uploads to be correctly processed by Gridsome. The trick is, and it doesnâ€™t seem to be documented on the Gridsome docs page, is to add `resolveAbsolutePaths: true` to your file system source options. Then, you get your media thatâ€™s uploaded through Forestry (or Netlify CMS too) to be correctly processed by Gridsomeâ€™s `g-image` component.
