I recently had a need to build a kind of one-off templating system at work. I
waffled around a lot when it came to the templating language. I bounced between
[EJS][], [Handlebars][], [Edge][], and [Nunjucks][]. Because I'm super familiar
with [Laravel Blade](https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/blade), I initially decided
on Edge, but Edge's documentation is pretty awful, and that just feels like a
bad sign. Nunjucks, on the other hand, has fantastic documentation and pretty
much all the features I want. I like Blade/Edge-style components more than
Nunjucks' macros, but I'm willing to make the trade-off. My needs for this
templating system are limited mostly to includes and layouts, with moderate
usage of components/macros.

After that, I need a way to auto-render as I'm developing. I started off with
[nodemon][], but I noticed a weird thing with using it as a module.

```javascript
const nodemon = require('nodemon')

nodemon({
  script: 'app.js',
  ext: 'njk'
})

nodemon.on('restart', files => console.log(files))
```

Nodemon has a nice event system that gives you info about what files triggered
the update, but you have to pass a script path into the config object. Since my
project just needs to run a function once per file save, not an ongoing
process, it felt weird passing a script it that didn't need to get run. It
worked, but felt weird.

After nodemon, I landed on [chokidar][]. Chokidar is a simpler file watcher. It
lets you do this.

```javascript
const path = require('path')
const builder = require('./app.js')

const watcher = require('chokidar')
  .watch('**/*.njk')
  .on('ready', () => console.log('Watching for changes...'))
  .on('change', filepath => {
    console.log(`${filepath} updated`)
    const data = path.parse(filepath)
    builder(data)
  })
```

It's a bit more direct and requires a little bit more care in how you setup the
output from scripts (because chokidar seems to eat the output from child
processes).

Lastly, I just include a call out to [BrowserSync][] to make hot reloading
possible. All in all, not a terrible setup. I'd normally be using [Nuxt][] for page
generation, but sometimes you have to deal with other peoples' terrible code.

*Update: like a hour after writing the original post*

Turns out, there's a [Nunjucks CLI project][nunjucks-cli]. It does pretty much
everything I hand-coded already. Run it like this:

`nunjucks '**/*.njk' -p templates -o dist data.json`

Processes all `.njk` files, with `templates` as the `src` directory, outputing to
`dist`, and all the data that needs to get passed to `render()` is in
`data.json`. I really should've known better. I guess though, while I did waste
a lot time figuring out some new things in Node.js, I learned a lot about Node
and its ecosystem at the same time.
