Don't get me wrongâ€”I love Vue. But I can't help getting excited by shining new
things (frameworks). I saw Rich Harris' ["Rethinking Reactivity"][] talk on
YouTube and remembered hearing him on Shop Talk. I figured I'd give [Svelte.js][] a
try. Svelte's big thing is that it only works as a compiler, requiring no inclusion
of library code (mostly, anyway) like Vue or React. I'm a minimalist at heart,
so this idea really appealed to me. Svelte even has its own Nuxt-style
framework built on top of Svelte called [Sapper][]. I decided to start there.

I've got a Sapper starter I forked and then updated the PostCSS and Tailwind plugins. [It's up on GitHub.](https://github.com/brandonpittman/sapper-default-starter)

After that, I had a pretty good setup.
