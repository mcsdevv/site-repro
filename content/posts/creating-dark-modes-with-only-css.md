I've seen a lot of buzz recently concerning dark modes and how to create them. The coming of dark mode in iOS seems to have triggered this, but I feel like everyone's going about it in the wrong way. Some people are creating solutions that check the `prefers-color-scheme` media query in CSS, but the majority of JavaScript-focused developers are taking a JS-only approach. They're using JS to programmatically check if the query is matched instead of just writing CSS to handle it. If it matches, they apply either a `light` class or a `dark` class. This works, but it seems unnecessary. If you're curious what the JS approach looks like, here you go.


I think the better solution to the problem is to lean into CSS custom properities. This can even be done with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) by creating a few classes that handle the most common color issues, and then flip those inside a media query that checks `prefers-color-scheme`. You get immediate theme handling that doesn't require parsing or execution of any JavaScript. 

```css
.text-default {
	@apply text-gray-900;
}

.bg-default {
	@apply bg-gray-100;
}

@media(prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
    .text-default {
      @apply text-gray-100;
    }  	
    
    .bg-default {
      @apply bg-gray-900;
    }
}
```

Yes, you'll be leaving IE11 theme support in the bin, but IE11 shouldn't be a top priority anyway. If it is, I doubt light and dark modes is an issue. Hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/brandonpittman) if you have thoughts.
