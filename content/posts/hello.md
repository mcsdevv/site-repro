Welcome to the new blog. Just moved over to using
[Gridsome](http://gridsome.org). It may seem like I've moved around a bit over
the last year or so, but something about the [JAMstack](http://jamstack.org) is really resonating with
me, so I don't forsee going back to Laravel/Rails/Adonis-blog generation in the
near future.
