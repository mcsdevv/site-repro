# About

I am a frontend engineer living in Nagoya, Japan but originally from
Cincinnati, Ohio. I first came to Japan in 2004 for study abroad and after
returning to the US for one year to finish my degrees in International
Relations and Asian Studies, I returned to Japan as an English teacher. After
working in private and public schools for a decade, I became a self-taught
programmer. I caught the programming bug while [automating
OmniFocus](/focusing). After seeing what could be done with code, I learned
Ruby and then Rails in hopes of turning my hobby into a career.

After struggling to find enjoyment with the backend, I realized how much I
enjoyed the frontend. While learning a bit of Laravel, I discovered
[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) and quickly fell in love. I left my job as a
teacher and began working in frontend development. Recently interested in
functional programming, I got into [ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io) and
then [ReasonReact](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/). With my newfound
passion for functional programming, I found that React made more sense to me
than Vue did, beginning my love affair with React.

I'm also deeply passionate about Tailwind. I've written a [number of Tailwind
plugins](https://github.com/brandonpittman/tailwindcss-plugin-fancy) and
promote the usage of atomic, functional, and utility-driven CSS whenever and
wherever possible. All my open-source work is up on
[Github](https://github.com/brandonpittman).

I'm married to a lovely woman whom I met by total chance at Oktoberfest in
Nagoya one lovely day in 2014. She's gorgeous, smart, and most importantly,
funny. We keep each other laughing on a daily basis and I'm lucky to have her.
No kids yet, but we're working on that.

I play video games in my free time. I love cooking, craft beer, and good
whisky. I love a good long bike ride on a nice days and I meet up with local
friends to play board games a couple times a month.

I practice Stoicism on a daily basis, journaling each morning and evening. If
you're like to read more about my journey with Stoicism, you'll find a [page
with my thoughts and a random Stoic quote generator](/stoic) on this site.

This site is home to lots of [blog posts](/writing) (mostly about programming
and personal productivity). I also have a number of public email newsletters
that I share over on [Mailbrew](https://app.mailbrew.com/blp).

If you're ever in need of help building a frontend project in React or Vue, or
if you need help with Tailwind CSS, I'm available for client work. You can [get
in touch with me here](/available).
