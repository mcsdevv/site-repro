## Why Stoicism?

Nothing's made a mark on me as of late quite the way Stoicism has. The main
reason I was interested in Stoicism was the idea that the Stoics knew how to
quell feelings of rage. I have battled my bad temper my whole life, and the
idea of learning to control it was appealing. The most notable result of
reading Stoic philosophy and journaling twice a day has been a reduction in
not instances of anger but a shortening in how long those feelings of anger
last. Where I use to stew in the juices of anger for hours, I've been able to
quickly stop myself, and ask "Why are you angry? Did that person you feel
offended you _intend to offend you_? Or are they possibly having a bad day
and slighted you by mistake? Or is it even possible that you just perceived
it as a slight?"

### Perception of Wrongdoings

There's an idea in Stoicism that you are not in control of anything but your
own thoughts. Because you're in control of your own mind though, any offense
you perceive is just that, your perception. If you do not feel like a victim,
then you are not a victim.

We are confronted with episodes in our lives that make us feel like others have
wronged us. Most of the time, we worry that we may have done something wrong
first, that we need to **fix the situation**. In reality, we can change the
thoughts, speech, and action of others as much as we can affect tomorrow's
weather forecast. The only power we have here is in our _perception_ of the
perceived wrong. If we tell ourselves, "you don't control anything but _you_
feel", we are more likely to avoid anger, resentment, and bitterness.
