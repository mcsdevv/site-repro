## Family

I got married on June 13, 2020. My wife and I had been together for over 5
years and living together for more than 2 years. The adjustment to married
life was smoothâ€”very little changed. We're planning on having kids soon
and trying to decide if we want to live in the US or stay in Japan. This
will largely depend on my future career plans. Should I happen to find a
frontend job back in the US, we might move to there in the next couple of
years.

## Work

I'm currently working for a company that specializes in online ad sales,
in their development section. We're currently working on v2 of our
advertisement management software platformâ€”currently in beta and launching
the public release in February 2021.

## Philosophy

I try to put the words of Stoics like Marcus Aurelius, Seneca, and Epictetus
into practice on a daily basis. I am working towards being able to separate the
things I cannot control from the things I can. To not get angry over things
beyond my control. Strict towards myself, yet tolerant towards others. _Momento
mori_ has had a profound effect on me. I keep the words, "you could leave life
right now" as the wallpaper on my iPhone to remind me throughout the day that
life is short and we must make the most of it. It also serves as a warning
against mindlessly picking up my phone. ðŸ™ƒ

## Side Projects

I'm working on a newsletter title _Developed in Isolation_ that chronicles
entrance to the programming world and the struggles of learning on your own
while living in a country that doesn't have English speakers to get help from.
It's a little bit about my history and a little bit about development culture
(and just culture in general) here in Japan, where I've lived for over 15
years.
