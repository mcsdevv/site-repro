# OmniFocus & AppleScript

I had previously written an OmniFocus library using JavaScript for
Automation, but it's got issues that vanilla AppleScript does not.
Also, I realized that I didn't really need the fancy regex abilities
from JavaScript that I thought I needed, so I went back to standard
AppleScript. It works just as well, and the source code is a lot more
readable. I hope you find this new library useful.

## Basic Usage

Put `omnifocus.scpt` in `~/Library/Script Libraries`, or else AppleScript won't know where to find it!

```applescript
use application "OmniFocus"
use O : script "omnifocus"

tell O
  set sel to selectedItems()
  deferDaily(sel)  # this will set all the selected tasks to start again after completion daily
  setDefer(sel, current date)

  set theTask to findTask("Log food") # find the first task whose name is "Log food"
  set theProject to findProject("Groceries")
  set theContext to findContext("Home")
  set theFolder to findFolder("Routine")

  # Parse using transport text (see below for details)
  parse("Do something! @home  ::misc #5pm #tomorrow //This is a note")
end
```

## Transport Text

For those who don't know about transport text, it's a format that
OmniFocus uses to parse task information like so:

`Do something! @home ::misc #5pm #tomorrow //This is a note`

The `!` makes `Do something` a flagged task. `@home` sets the context to
"home". `::` is used for matching a project. Both `@` and `::` will fuzzy match
existing contexts and projects. The first `#` is used for a defer date, while
the second `#` is for a due date. Both support natural language parsing like
the inspector in OmniFocus. Word of caution though, if only one `#` is present,
OmniFocus assumes it's a due date. Lastly, `//` starts the note for a task.
While more involved ways of creating OmniFocus tasks exist in the library,
you'll find using `of.parse` as your primary means of creating tasks.
